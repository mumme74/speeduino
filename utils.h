This function retuns a pulsewidth time (in us) using a either Alpha-N or Speed Density algorithms, given the following:
REQ_FUEL
VE: Lookup from the main MAP vs RPM fuel table
MAP: In KPa, read from the sensor
GammaE: Sum of Enrichment factors (Cold start, acceleration). This is a multiplication factor (Eg to add 10%, this should be 110)
injDT: Injector dead time. The time the injector take to open minus the time it takes to close (Both in uS)
TPS: Throttle position (0% to 100%)

This function is called by PW_SD and PW_AN for speed0density and pure Alpha-N calculations respectively.
